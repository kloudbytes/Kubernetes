# Oline Playground:
K8s online playgrounds are web-based platforms that allow users to interactively explore and learn Kubernetes (K8s) without the need for local installations. These playgrounds typically offer pre-configured Kubernetes clusters in a sandbox environment where users can experiment with deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

## 1. What is Killercoda?

Killercoda is a place where you open your browser and get instant access to a real Linux or Kubernetes environment ready to use. These environments are maintained remotely and accessed locally, hence no setup or huge resource usage in local browsers. As a user you can learn from existing scenarios and as a creator you can provide scenarios to teach any kind of tools or technologies.

 ## What is killerCoda main goal?
Simplicity and Availability! We want to provide our interactive learning engine to as many users and creators as possible, and this with lowest possible effort on the consuming side =>       just open your browser.

## 2. Play with Kubernetes Classroom:

The Play with Kubernetes classroom is a new site provided by Docker that helps you get hands-on experience using Kubernetes. We provide a workshop that will allow you, in the browser, to follow a Kubernetes tutorial without having to install a single thing.
