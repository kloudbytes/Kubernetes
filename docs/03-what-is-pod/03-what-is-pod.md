# What is pod ? 
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host": it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host.

A Pod is similar to a set of containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.

Pods in a Kubernetes cluster are used in two main ways:

* **Pods that run a single container**. The "one-container-per-Pod" model is the
  most common Kubernetes use case; in this case, you can think of a Pod as a
  wrapper around a single container; Kubernetes manages Pods rather than managing
  the containers directly.
* **Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together**. A Pod can
  encapsulate an application composed of
  [multiple co-located containers](#how-pods-manage-multiple-containers) that are
  tightly coupled and need to share resources. These co-located containers
  form a single cohesive unit.

  Grouping multiple co-located and co-managed containers in a single Pod is a
  relatively advanced use case. You should use this pattern only in specific
  instances in which your containers are tightly coupled.



## Using Pods

The following is an example of a Pod which consists of a container running the image `nginx:1.14.2`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
